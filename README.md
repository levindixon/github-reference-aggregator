# GitHub Reference Aggregator
_A Chrome extension that makes it easy to find all of an issue's references._

## Installation

[Add to Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/github-reference-aggregat/jikhppmpafhplndfedldogehgpjiiekm)

After adding to Chrome you'll need to add a personal access token with the `repo` scope to GRA via its extension options.

For more information on how to generate your token, please visit the [GitHub help docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## ðŸ¤” Why?

Sometimes finding references to the issue you're currently viewing can be tough:

## ðŸ˜® So what does this do to help?

When an issue has been referenced, all of its references will be aggregated at the bottom of its description in a convenient little `<details>` block:

## ðŸ‘€ Let's see that again:

When the issue loads, GitHub Reference Aggregator fetches all of the references made to it. When it finds any references, it adds a `<details>` block with all of those references to the bottom of the issue's description:
